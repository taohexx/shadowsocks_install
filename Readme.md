- Shadowsocks&Shadowsocks-libev&Shadowsocks-go&ShadowsocksR

- Something helpful: If you meet the case `**"-bash permission denied"**` on CentOS when you run script like `*.sh` from this page,please 
  try to use this command `"chmod 777 *.sh"` before you run the script.
  
  e.g: If you wanna run `"shadowsocks-libev.sh"` but meet the `"permission denied"`,use the command `"chmod 777 shadowsocks-libev.sh"`,and 
  then,you can run `"shadowsocks-libev.sh"` without any problems.
